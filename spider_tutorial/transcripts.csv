Don't Let the Angels Fall (1969) - full transcript,"Robert, a Canadian businessman depressed by a sense of failure of his personal and professional lives, attends an insurance convention in the US and inevitably has an affair with a woman there. He returns to his family in Montreal; his cold marriage to his wife Barbara and two sons ages 19 and 13. His family life continues to disintegrate when his older son becomes romantically involved with a night-club singer who encourages him to participate in protests on his campus and his younger son, confused and insecure, skips school and dreams of running away. His wife is stuck in the middle; she suspects Robert had an affair and no longer feels adequate as a mother and wife. Robert continues to become more distant from his family and is increasingly distraught with his lack of ambition, wishing to do something that matters.","What love,What love,Oh, Freddie!

,The Father General is here,with the gentlemen.,Good morning. Good morning,,Father Antonelli. Morning.,Father Antonelli,,there seems to have been a,regrettable misunderstanding.,Our friends... May I?,My dear Professor.,Weren't you responsible for the,work on Masaccio's crucifixion,which was restored here,at the Institute last year?,Two years ago. Two years ago.,It was displayed last month at,the Staatliche Museum in Berlin.,Oh, I didn't know.,Unfortunately something rather,disagreeable has occurred.,One of our experts, one of the very,best men we have in Germany seems,to be on the opinion you understand,,that it was, er...,Fake.,Strange.,A very good one to be sure but,of slightly more recent vintage.,The panel itself is 15th Century,,early 15th Century according,to the experts when Masaccio,was in Florence.,But chromatographic analysis of the,paint has revealed that this Masaccio,was painted a little,less than two years ago.,Father Antonelli, do you paint?,May I know the name of this expert?,Seiglau Stuttgart,,you know him of course.,Only by name. One of the greatest,art forgers in Europe.,Then we may safely assume that he,is an authority on the subject.,My business,is restoring works of art.,It wouldn't be the first time I,have heard of an original denounced,as a forgery,,or a forgery taken for an original.,Let us simply say,an error was made on the part,of whoever sent the painting.,He mistook the copy for the,original. I sent the painting.,I packed it myself when I was,ordered to ship it to Germany.,Then nothing would be easier,than for you to prove,it's authenticity or not.,I fervently hope so.,And the people of Germany have,taken Masaccio to their heart.,It would be cruel to disillusion,them, would it not, Father?,Of course. You will, erm,,you will look into it immediately,,will you not, Father?,It was a mistake. Yes. And,every man is entitled to a mistake.,One mistake.,I shall do everything possible.,The impossible too let us hope.,The church has always thrived,on doing the impossible.,You know who they are,,Father, don't you?,LOUD EXPLOSION,A BABY WAILS,On the 17th of March you went,to a hiding place near the,Risorgimento bridge to remove,a wireless transmitter which you use,for contacting the Headquarters,of the American 5th Army and,the Partisan movement,in the state of Lazio.,Nothing to say?,What would you do in my place?,What would you do in mine?,- I'd have you shot.,- Not before I'd talked.,I didn't think of that.,But then I'm not a policeman.,(You're wanted at Headquarters.),Carry on, Schutz.,PHONE RINGS,Hello. Yes.,Yes, Father. Father Pancrazio.,Good evening, Father General.,You can be sure he wants to,talk about the Florentine arts.,We simply cannot stand in their way.,You must also realise that,Colonel Kappler went to you today,prepared to do his best.,If he has to come back tomorrow, you,can rely upon him to do his worst.,They will take away everything.,Down to the very last painting,and the very last restorer,,including yourself.,Oh, I understand the,situation perfectly.,We sit here like sheep watching,Rome being plundered in a way,that would put the Vandals shame.,I know, my son, I know.,But you are aware of the mission,the Holy Father has given me.,It is one of extreme delicacy.,Negotiations with the,Germans at the highest level,for the safeguarding of all Rome.,I am asking you to choose,the lesser of two evils.,Are you asking me,,or is this an order?,An order, Father Antonelli.,An order.,I thank you, my son.,May Jesus Christ be praised.,May He be praised forever.,What would you do?,Should we barricade ourselves,inside the institute and say, ""Come,,get it if you have the courage."",If everybody were ready to,resist that way, I'd say yes.,The trouble is the people are,exhausted and disillusioned.,Then we'll put up,passive resistance.,No. I think it's about time,Italians find themselves,some national conscience after,20 years of dictatorship.,Kappler, good of you to come.,You sent for me, General.,The Duce's new Minister for the,Interior, His Excellency, er...,Guido Buffarini-Guidi.,The Duce says that he's,the most hated man in Italy.,Hated and feared.,And as we say in Italy,,the Duce's always right.,In that event Your Excellency,,I'm glad to hear we're not the,only ones the Italians hate.,Ah, Police Chief Caruso,,good of you to come.,Kappler, His Excellency is most,unhappy because of the difficulties,you have raised about the,celebrations for tomorrow, the...,The 25th anniversary of,the founding of the Fascist party.,On the contrary, I've raised,no difficulties whatsoever.,Providing that the,festivities were held behind,- closed doors.,- Which means YOU have,prevented the members of our new,Fascist Republican party,from parading through Rome.,I did nothing of the sort.,I simply pointed out to the,Head of your party that,this seemed hardly the time,to provoke the citizens of Rome,with a demonstration which they would,find unpopular to say the least.,Such talk is inadmissible, Colonel.,All Colonel Kappler meant,is he doesn't consider,that a public demonstration,in Rome could come,of without incidents.,Our men will safeguard,law and order.,Then who would be left,to do the parading.,Would your Excellency be kind,enough to listen to a list of raids,and sabotage acts committed in,the last 10 days against the German,Armed Forces and our fascist allies?,We're aware there are,some criminal elements.,Yes, yes. They're ingenious,,audacious and well organised,,and they have a strategy, we know.,What strategy?,Block our supply lines.,Turn Rome into hostile territory,and make us withdraw.

Who are they Kappler?,11th Company SS Bolzen Police,,sent here from the Tyrol recently.,Local security is considered,by all, including His,Holiness to be inadequate.,I have ordered the 11th Company,to march through the centre,of Rome every day as...,for psychological reasons. But,that will be cancelled for tomorrow.,To march through the city on the day,of Fascism's glorious anniversary,would be useless provocation.,No-one would dare,attack German troops.,General, I'm forced to insist.,Are you in charge or is this Colonel?,I am in charge. Commandant of Rome.,And where will be no parade,tomorrow. Cancel, finished.,Celebrate whatever it is you want,to celebrate, but indoors!,Kappler.,Sir.,Now sit down. Sir.,You don't like our allies,very much, do you?,You asking my opinion, sir?,Politics is not strictly my field,but I would say that Fascism is dead.,It must disappear so that we,can hold onto the last vestige,of our prestige here in Italy.,This means the,elimination of Mussolini.,And if I were ordered to do so,,I would know exactly,how to go about it.,You say this.,You organised his rescue.,Our opinions, General,,are rarely heard.,More often, we do as we are told.,Yes. You will do as you are told.,The Fascist parade is cancelled, but,our SS column continues to patrol.,They are fully armed, I presume.,My boys can take care of themselves.,Tomorrow, they march.,Tomorrow, sir,,they march.,Elena here, carrying,the raincoat. Paolo here.,The rest here, here and here.,When you get the signal, Paolo,,you light the fuse.,Elena here, walking.

Le 4ème pouvoir (1985) - full transcript,"He, Yves Dorget, is a major reporter in a daily newspaper. She, Catherine Carré, is a TV news anchor. They had a love affair together, when she was a young beginner journalist, but her ambition and her desire to arrive had separated them. Today, the news brings them back together: he is taken as a hostage and then released by a thug on the run, a thief but not a killer. She holds a cassette proving the compromise of the Prime Minister in a political assassination. The two cases overlap. The news item joins the underside of politics. How will both react? For him, his professional conscience going hand in hand with his rigorous morality, there is only one truth that we owe to the public. For her, the path to choose is more difficult, divided between rediscovered love, her demand for professional integrity and - the seduction of an ambiguous solution.

pendulum clock,,wasn't that quite a while ago?,But they used to be massive.,Now, they are getting smaller and smaller.,Bastard of the industry of the rich.,The worker has neither hearth,nor home.,The worker,has no fatherland.,Miserable worker,,Raise today,your hand.,Tomorrow we will claim,a republic of humankind.,And the kings have set frontiers,,between the working peoples.,Spreading murderous

"Who Are You, Polly Maggoo? (1966) - full transcript","This excoriating satire of the fashion industry follows 20-year-old Brooklyn-born fashion model Polly Maggoo in Paris, on the runway at the big shows where magazine editor Ms. Maxwell is the reigning opinion maker and the ridiculous passes for sublime. Polly becomes the subject of an episode of vapid TV news-documentary series ""Qui êtes-vous?"" and is pursued by the filmmaker and by the prince of Borodine, a small country in the Soviet bloc. We watch as the documentary is shot, we await Polly's arrival in the principality, we observe a lunch in the suburbs, and we learn of her childhood. Is there more to Polly than her pretty face?
